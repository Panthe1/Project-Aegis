# Project-Aegis

A Pterodacyl Management Suite tailored toward discord bot automation.

The Pterodactyl "One-Touch" Minecraft Deployment Suite
Welcome to the ultimate solution for Minecraft server administration. This suite isn't just a Discord bot; it's a complete infrastructure-as-code toolkit designed to take two blank servers and turn them into a fully operational, modpack-deploying Pterodactyl instance, all managed from a single, powerful Python script.
Forget manual setups and tedious configurations. We automate everything from the installation of Pterodactyl Panel and its Wings daemon to the final, one-click deployment of any CurseForge modpack from Discord.

‚ú® Core Features
Full Infrastructure Automation: Install Pterodactyl Panel and Wings on separate Ubuntu servers with simple command-line flags.
Touchless Modpack Deployment: Our custom Pterodactyl Egg, installed automatically, handles any modpack you throw at it.
Intelligent Server Pack Detection: Automatically searches for and prioritizes official server packs for the most stable setup.
Robust Fallback & Repair Logic: If a pack is misconfigured (e.g., a Fabric pack with a Forge installer), the script identifies the true loader type and installs it correctly.
Adaptive Loader Installation: Natively handles Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge, including version differences and author packaging errors.
Automatic Client Mod Cleanup: When installing a client pack, it removes known client-side mods to ensure a smooth server launch.
User-Friendly Discord Interface: Manage everything from a powerful yet simple Discord bot.
üìã Prerequisites
To start, you will need:
Two Blank Ubuntu Servers:
One for the Pterodactyl Panel (Bare metal or VM, minimum 2GB RAM, 2vCPU recommended).
One for the Wings Daemon (Bare metal or VM, this is where game servers will run).
Both servers must be running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
A Domain or Subdomain: This will be used to access your Pterodactyl Panel (e.g., panel.yourdomain.com). You should point its DNS A record to the Panel server's public IP address.
Python 3.10+ and Pip installed on both Ubuntu servers.
A CurseForge API Key: Request one from the CurseForge Developer Portal.
A Discord Bot Application with its token. Create one at the Discord Developer Portal.
üöÄ The "One-Touch" Installation Workflow
This guide walks you through the entire process, from blank servers to a running bot.
Step 1: Prepare Your Servers
On both of your fresh Ubuntu 22.04 servers, perform the following initial setup:
Update the system:
Generated bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install Python, Pip, and Git:
Generated bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git -y
Use code with caution.
Bash
Clone the Project Repository:
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install Python Dependencies:
Generated bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
Step 2: Install Pterodactyl Panel
On the machine designated to be your Panel server, run the script with the --install-panel flag. This will begin an automated installation of the Pterodactyl Panel and all its dependencies (Nginx, MariaDB, Redis, etc.).
Generated bash
python3 p.py --install-panel
Use code with caution.
Bash
The script will prompt you for necessary information, such as your domain name, database credentials, and an admin user account for the panel. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully.
Step 3: Install Pterodactyl Wings
On the machine designated to be your Wings server, run the script with the --install-wings flag. This will install the Wings daemon, which is responsible for running your game servers.
Generated bash
python3 p.py --install-wings
Use code with caution.
Bash
The script will ask for the URL of your new Pterodactyl Panel and an auto-generated token to link the two systems. It will guide you through creating a new "Node" in your panel and pasting the configuration.
Step 4: Verify Connection and Configure the Bot
Once both installations are complete, log into your Pterodactyl Panel at the domain you configured.
Import the Egg (Future: Automatic):
For now, this is the only manual step. Follow the Egg Import Guide below to install the Universal Installer Egg. In future versions, the bot will handle this automatically upon first run.
Generate API Keys:
Application API Key: Go to Admin -> Application API, create a key with Read & Create permissions for Servers, and Read permissions for all other categories.
Client API Key: Go to your user icon -> Account -> API Credentials, and create a new key.
Configure the Bot:
On your Panel server (or a third machine), copy config.json.example to config.json.
Fill in all the required values:
Generated json
{
  "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
  "PTERODACTYL_PANEL_URL": "https://panel.yourdomain.com",
  "PTERO_APP_API_KEY": "YOUR_APPLICATION_API_KEY_HERE",
  "PTERO_CLIENT_API_KEY": "YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY_HERE",
  "CURSEFORGE_API_KEY": "YOUR_CURSEFORGE_API_KEY_HERE",
  "server_creation_defaults": {
    "nest_id_minecraft": "1", // Default Nest ID for Minecraft
    "universal_installer_egg_id": "ID_OF_THE_IMPORTED_EGG"
  }
}
Use code with caution.
Json
Step 5: Run the Bot
Now, you can run the bot in its primary monitoring mode. It's highly recommended to use a process manager like screen or systemd to ensure the bot runs 24/7.
Using screen (simple method):
Generated bash
# Start a new screen session named "discordbot"
screen -S discordbot

# Run the bot inside the session
python3 p.py

# Detach from the session by pressing Ctrl+A, then D.
# The bot will keep running. To re-attach later, use: screen -r discordbot
Use code with caution.
Bash
Your system is now fully operational!
üéÆ Using the Bot to Install a Modpack
With the bot running, you can deploy servers from any Discord channel it has access to.
Command: /install_server
Parameters:
server_key: A short, unique key for the server (e.g., atm9).
server_name: The display name for the server (e.g., All The Mods 9).
project_id: The CurseForge Project ID of the modpack.
file_id (Optional): A specific CurseForge File ID to install a specific version.
Example 1: Auto-installing the latest server pack
Leave the file_id option blank. The script will automatically find the best server pack available.
/install_server server_key:atm9 server_name:All The Mods 9 project_id:715572
Example 2: Installing a specific version
Find the numerical File ID from the CurseForge "Files" tab and provide it.
/install_server server_key:tek3 server_name:Techopolis 3 project_id:1193409 file_id:6686603
The bot will handle the rest. It will create the server in Pterodactyl, run the installer, and notify you when it's complete and starting up.
‚ùì Troubleshooting
API Request resulted in errors... must be a string: This is a legacy error. If you encounter it, ensure your Egg's variable validation for MODPACK_FILE_ID is set to nullable|string in the Pterodactyl Panel.
Server crashes on startup: The installation was successful, but the modpack itself has issues (e.g., mod conflicts). This is not an installer error. Check the server console and the modpack's official issue page for solutions.
Installation fails with No such file or directory: This can happen if the pack author has made a critical error in their server pack zip. Report the issue on the project's GitHub.
