# Project Aegis - Beta Testing License Agreement

This Beta Testing License Agreement applies to all pre-release (alpha/beta) versions of the Project Aegis software suite ("the Software").

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to the following terms:

## 1. Grant of License
The developer grants you a temporary, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software for the sole purpose of testing and evaluation.

## 2. Permitted Use
- You **ARE PERMITTED** to install and use the Software on your Pterodactyl Panel instances for personal or community use during the official beta testing period.
- You **ARE PERMITTED** to provide feedback, bug reports, and suggestions to the developer.

## 3. Restrictions
- You **ARE NOT PERMITTED** to redistribute, resell, or share the Software files with others. Instead, please direct them to the official GitHub repository to download it themselves.
- You **ARE NOT PERMITTED** to use the Software for commercial hosting purposes (i.e., as a paid feature of a Game Server Provider) without explicit written permission from the developer.
- You **ARE NOT PERMITTED** to modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works from the Software.
- You **ARE NOT PERMITTED** to use the beta version of the Software after the official beta testing period has concluded.

## 4. No Warranty
The Software is provided "as-is" without any warranty of any kind. The developer is not liable for any damages, data loss, or server issues that may arise from its use.

## 5. Termination
This license is effective until terminated. It will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of the terms. The developer reserves the right to end the beta testing period at any time, at which point your right to use the beta Software is revoked.
